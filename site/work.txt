I tailor my services to fit the projects in the best ways possible.
I am based in Stockholm, but I am open for relocating if necessary.
I will make sure the project is due in time.
If no major work is required, check out my gigs instead:

- 'Consulting'  - General help with finding solutions to your project.
- 'Contracting' - I write/maintain your code.
- 'Tutoring'    - Learn how to solve problems using code.
- 'Clustering'  - Parallel computing for educational purposes.

Try typing any of the ones listed above for a more detailed answer.
