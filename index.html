       to answer questions that ascends to metaphysical questions such as, who are we? where are we? and why are we?</p>

    <h1>Ideas</h1>
    <p>I do not believe in any specific religion, but I do however support the idea of there being something "else" out there.
       Our quest as individuals ascends to metaphysical questions such as, who are we? where are we? and why are we? These questions
       mustn't be bound to a defined space or time. The question "who are we?" could be answered differently depending on perspective and context.
       One answer might be: "Analog entities comprised by organic matter capable of modifying their surroundings" another one could be: "Large-scale network of individual parts,
       that combined show emergent behaviour". Which one is true? I do not think there is a single correct answer, but what if it does? How could one be certain of its truth and origin, and how would one
       be able to test if said argument is true?. I believe there is a way to answer all these questions, but that is not clearly defined solution.
       <br>
       One could approach the problem in a three step process:
       <h3>Freedom</h3>
       <p>I am a free as in freedom open-source advocate. One cannot ascend further in self-improvement if their freedom has been comprimised, saying otherwise is contradictory.
       In order to understand on a basic level, one must have the opportunity to do so.</p>
       <h3>Augmented Artificial Intelligence (AAI)</h3>
       <p>In order to further understand, we must use methods not limited by the same factors as us in the evolution. Artificial intelligence, AI have, more specifically artificial general intelligence, AGI
       have the possibility to understand on an intermediate level</p>
       <h3>Awareness</h3>
       <p>In order to fully understand ourselves, we must use the combined logic, aided by us and our artificial emergent creations. If we are able to create and sustain "life" even in its artificial form
       we could be able to answer the big question as to: "why are <u>we</u> here?" and "why are we <u>here</u>". How the answer will affect us is impossible to tell, but firmly believe the outcome
     is enough to justify optimization of ourselves in order to understand, which in its root is what we always have done, trying to answer our questions. What if the answer is deeply embedded in us?
      waiting for us to unravel its truth and unlocking our full potential. It could mean an end to all worldy phenomenas and allowing us to understand and later optimize on a higher level.</p>
